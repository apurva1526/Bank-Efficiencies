# Bank-Efficiencies
:  Different Data Envelopement Analysis techniques such as Constant Returns to Scale model (CRS), Variable Returns to scale model (VRS) and Slack Based Model (SBM) are used to optimize the operating practice of different banks.These techniques helps us to compare inputs and ouputs of banks which will be the decision making units (DMUs) of our model by evaluating their efficiencies. Further MATLAB is used for implementing the above mentioned models.
